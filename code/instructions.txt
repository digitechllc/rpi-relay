This code is specifically for use with the PCB I created; it uses GPIO 23, which is hard-coded into the source code.
If you need to change this to use the software with a different GPIO port, change line 11 before compiling.

Download amp-on.c.  
Download Makefile.
Download init.sh

type "make"

Overwrite the init script with init.sh: mv init.sh /etc/init.d
