rpi-relay
=========

This project was born from a desire to have my Raspberry Pi be used to stream music via AirPlay. I then realized the Raspberry Pi could also control a relay to turn on or off a connected amplifier. While I was designing the PCB, I decided to also add a DS18B20 temperature sensor as well.

A step-by-step guide can be found in instructions.txt.
