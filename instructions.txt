So you want to make your Raspberry Pi automatically turn on & off an amplifier when you stream music to it via AirPlay?  Well, I have the answer for you!

NOTE: Currently the board is only laid out for Raspberry Pi Models A & B.  I am working on designs for A+ and B+, and will update this once I've finished them.

ALTERNATE SOLUTION:  Use a Powerswitch Tail (http://www.adafruit.com/products/268) from Adafruit. Caveat: you won't get the temperature sensor. 

Hardware:
	* Order the PCB's from OshPark
	* Order the remaining parts from vendors as listed on Bill of Materials (BOM.txt).
	When all has arrived:
		* Solder the 220-ohm resistor to R2
		* Solder the 4k7-ohm resistor to R3
		* Solder the DS18B20
		* Solder the header connector
		* Solder the Solid State Relay
		* Solder the terminal block
	* Plug the module onto the Raspberry Pi.  There's really only one orientation that it will go on. See photo of installed board.

Software:
	* Acquire & Install Shairport (https://github.com/abrasive/shairport)
	* Setup the 1-wire temperature sensor. Adafruit has an excellent guide: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-11-ds18b20-temperature-sensing/overview
	* Acquire my software from the code directory; follow the directions in that directory.
